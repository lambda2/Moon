Moon, A light and smart PHP Framework
====================================

**Currently, this project is not functional.**

It aims to develop a framework smart able to manage alone entities of 
the application, allowing to the developer the really important things.

Languages:
------------
Sorry, but for the moment, all the comments are written in french. The classes are in english for conventions.
When the project will be a little bit more advanced (and functionnal), an english translation will come.
