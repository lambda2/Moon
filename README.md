Moon, A light and smart PHP Framework
====================================

**Currently, this project is not functional.**

It aims to develop a smart framework, able to manage alone the entities of 
the application, and allowing the developer to focus on really important things.

Languages:
------------
Sorry, but for the moment, a big part of the comments are written in french (for myself). The classes are in english for conventions.
When the project will be a little bit more advanced (and functionnal), an english translation will come.

Copyrights
---------
By default, use the TWIG template engine (Thanks to [@Fabpot](https://github.com/fabpot)).
